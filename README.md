A/B testing methods are used to drive data-informed decisions. By comparing key metrics such as Revenue Per User, Conversion Rate, and Feature Engagement between Control and Variation groups, actionable insights are identified  as well as opportunities for improvement. While the initial changes did not yield statistically significant results, the analysis revealed potential growth areas, including segment-specific strategies for tablet users and the South region. This project demonstrates how  to leverage scalable experimentation, interpret complex data, and propose targeted solutions to enhance user experience and business performance.
